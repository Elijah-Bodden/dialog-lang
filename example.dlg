I have a secret: This program calculates the fibonacci sequence.

Let x be 1 and let y be 1.
Do let x be x plus y and let y be x minus y and shout x until x is bigger than 100.

I have a secret: This program uses a function for fizzbuzz.

Let fizzbuzz be a todo list with n: if n over 3 is 0 please shout "fizz" and if n over 5 is 0 please shout "buzz" and if n over 15 is 0 please shout "fizzbuzz".

Do let n be 1 and fizzbuzz until n is bigger than 100.
